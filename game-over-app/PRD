## Introduction
### Project description
Game-Over.app is an AI-powered mobile-first platform that redefines the planning,
booking, execution, and post-management of bachelor and bachelorette parties. The iOS and
Android app eliminates common event-planning headaches—conflicting group interests,
endless coordination, relationship strain, and stress-heavy logistics—by providing "Alles aus
einer Hand" (everything from one source) through a fully automated and smart process.
After capturing detailed input from organizers about the bride/groom's personality and
the group's preferences in two separate steps, the AI suggests curated experience
packages (S = 3 activities, M = 4 activities, and L = 5 activities). The platform
includes advanced communication tools, structured voting mechanisms, and conflict
resolution features to eliminate the "Group Chat Chaos" that causes relationship
strain. Once a package is selected that aligns with the majority of participants'
preferences, the app handles booking all activities and prepares to accompany the
group throughout the bachelor party—ensuring an unforgettable experience without chaos
or damaged friendships.
### Key Innovation: Relationship Preservation Technology
Game-Over.app isn't just a party planning tool—it's a relationship preservation
platform that prevents the "Alptraum" (nightmare) of coordination chaos that often
damages friendships during the planning process.
### Purpose of this document
This Product Requirements Document (PRD) serves as the authoritative reference for the
Game-Over.app's development team, stakeholders, and other interested parties. It
details the functional and non-functional requirements, user stories, technical
specifications, and design guidelines necessary to successfully build and launch the
initial MVP of the application.
### Scope
The MVP scope includes:
- User authentication and account creation
- Event creation and management
- AI-driven preference capturing and matching
- Package suggestion and selection
- Participant feedback collection with structured voting
- Booking and payment flow with service fee integration
- Initial geographic coverage: Hamburg, Hannover, and Berlin
- Package sizes: S, M, and L
- Comprehensive budget management and transparency
- Advanced communication and voting tools
- Social sharing and community features
Future iterations (not in MVP scope):
- Expanded geographic coverage to full DACH region
- Additional package sizes
- Execution companion with mini-games and live features
- Post-event media sharing and video recaps
- Cost tracking post-event
