# Go-Live Checklist

This document tracks all tasks that must be completed before launching the Game Over app to production.

## Authentication & OAuth

### Apple Sign-In (Required for iOS App Store)
**Status:** ⏸️ Pending - Requires Apple Developer Account ($99/year)

**Requirements:**
- [ ] Enroll in Apple Developer Program ($99/year)
- [ ] Create App ID in Apple Developer Portal with "Sign in with Apple" capability
- [ ] Configure Services ID for OAuth
- [ ] Generate Key ID and download Private Key (.p8 file)
- [ ] Get your Team ID from Apple Developer Portal
- [ ] Add redirect URLs in Apple Developer Portal
- [ ] Configure Supabase Auth with Apple provider credentials
- [ ] Test Apple Sign-In flow on physical iOS device
- [ ] Submit app for App Store review

**Documentation:** https://developer.apple.com/sign-in-with-apple/

**Supabase Configuration (Once Apple Developer Account is Set Up):**

1. **In Supabase Dashboard:**
   - Go to Authentication > Providers
   - Find **Apple** in the providers list and click it
   - Toggle **"Enable Sign in with Apple"** to ON

2. **You'll need these credentials from Apple Developer Portal:**
   - **Services ID**: Your OAuth Services ID (e.g., `app.gameover.ios.signin`)
   - **Team ID**: Found in Apple Developer Account > Membership
   - **Key ID**: Generated when you create a Sign in with Apple key
   - **Private Key**: The `.p8` file you download (only available once!)

3. **In Apple Developer Portal, configure redirect URL:**
   - Add: `https://stdbvehmjpmqbjyiodqg.supabase.co/auth/v1/callback`

**Notes:**
- Apple requires all apps with third-party social login to also offer Apple Sign-In
- This is mandatory for App Store approval if you have Google/Facebook login
- Testing Apple Sign-In requires a physical iOS device (won't work in simulator fully)
- The Private Key (.p8 file) can only be downloaded once - store it securely!

### Facebook OAuth Configuration
**Status:** ⏸️ Pending - Development configured, production needs updates

**Current Status:**
- ✅ Facebook App created (App ID: `2083822122367839`)
- ✅ Development key hash configured: `nRhx4vJ1AplGGXP2zzPBiwMYAzc=`
- ✅ OAuth redirect URL configured: `https://stdbvehmjpmqbjyiodqg.supabase.co/auth/v1/callback`
- ✅ App domains configured: `stdbvehmjpmqbjyiodqg.supabase.co`
- ❌ Release key hash not yet generated
- ❌ Production domains not yet added

**Action Required for Production:**

1. **Generate Android Release Key Hash:**
   ```bash
   keytool -exportcert -alias YOUR_RELEASE_KEY_ALIAS \
     -keystore YOUR_RELEASE_KEY_PATH \
     | openssl sha1 -binary \
     | openssl base64
   ```
   Then add the release key hash to:
   - Facebook Developer Console > Your App > Settings > Basic > Key Hashes

2. **Update App Domains (if using custom Supabase domain):**
   - Add `game-over.app` to App Domains
   - Add `auth.game-over.app` if using custom Supabase domain

3. **Update OAuth Redirect URLs (if using custom Supabase domain):**
   - Keep: `https://stdbvehmjpmqbjyiodqg.supabase.co/auth/v1/callback`
   - Add: `https://auth.game-over.app/auth/v1/callback` (if custom domain configured)

4. **Switch Facebook App to Live Mode:**
   - Go to Settings > Basic
   - Toggle "App Mode" from Development to Live
   - Fill in required information (Privacy Policy URL, etc.)

**Note:** The release keystore is different from the debug keystore. You'll create this when setting up app signing for the Play Store.
